# Haversine Distance Problem

This repository is an attempt at the first problem in Casey Muratori's 
[Performance Aware Programming](https://www.computerenhance.com/) series.

The problem will be to optimize an implementation of the haversine
distance problem, starting with a python implementation.

## Generating input data

We are testing against a 10 million data point input for the initial
tests. Includes in this repo is a utility to generate this random
data.

```
cd gen_haversine_data
cargo run -r -- 10000000
```

This will write the file `data_10000000_flex.json` to the local directory.

## Naive python

Naive python script found in `naive.py`

## Rust implementation

Rust implementation included with a comparsion between `serde_json` and `simd_json`.

## Testing

Test script included to generate data sets of `10000`, `100000`, `1000000`, `10000000`
and then run each one through the test suite

```
./test.sh
```
